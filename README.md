# BlazorRogueLike

This is a crazy idea where the game field is rendered using DIVs instead of
something performant like a Canvas or WebGL. This is totally crazy and it's 
working!

The code right now is terrible because I didn't want to spend a lot of time if
the idea was going to fail. Since now I know the idea will work I will make it
better!
